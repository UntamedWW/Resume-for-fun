# resume-for-fun

> 🖥️ My very first front-end coding experiment: a simple online résumé.

A tiny project to showcase my growing skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-for-fun.git
````

2. **Open**

   * Navigate into the folder: `cd resume-for-fun`
   * Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 📦 What’s Inside

* **index.html** – the main résumé layout
* **css/styles.css** – custom styles using Montserrat font
* **img/** – placeholder photo

---

## 🤔 Why “resume-for-fun”?

* It’s literally my **first** attempt at building something from scratch.
* Proof I’m leveling up from “just learning” to “actually shipping.”

---

## 👀 Next Steps

* Add responsive breakpoints
* Polish animations & interactive bits
* Maybe throw in a bit of JavaScript magic

> That’s it! Feel free to poke around, break it, and let me know how I can level up my code.
